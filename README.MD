# Financial Calculators
#### Since this was my first time creating a java code I enjoyed getting stuck and recreating the whole line. When I had started to code I was just writing my own equations but then later realized that it not the right equation I'm using. 
#### With the help of the hint I was able to understand, but then I realize, later my issue was with using Math.pow, instead of using Math.pow I wrote math.pow. I had to refer back to the workbook and realized that "M" needs to be capitalized. 
#### Following issue was with "souf" I was using "+" rather than "," it took me a bit to figure it out. 

#### The way I made my code to understand easier is by calculating time and interest beforehand.
